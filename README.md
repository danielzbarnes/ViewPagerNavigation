# ViewPagerNavigation
 Simple app combining ViewPager2 with Jetpack Navigation using the default Android Navigation Drawer Activity Project.
 
 Takes advantage of ViewPager2's TabLayoutMediator to control switching between tabs while still utilizing Jetpack Navigation.
 Interestingly, when navigating from a ViewPager's fragment, the navigation directions occur from the ViewPager container fragment rather than the fragment itself.
